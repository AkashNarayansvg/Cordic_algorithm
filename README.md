# Cordic_algorithm
Implementation of cordic algorithm in verilog

In this project coridc algorithm is used to calculate the values for sine and cosine angles using __coordinate__ __rotation__ technique and a small lookup tables.

Cordic algorithm is widely used in signal processing domain like SDR to efficiently compute trigonometric , logarithmic and exponential values by using a iterative algorithm and reducing the use of hardware.
